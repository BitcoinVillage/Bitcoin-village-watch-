# Bitcoin Village Watch

## Bringing Bitcoin’s transparency to villages — water, funds, and public resources.

Bitcoin taught us transparent money. We're applying the same to village resources — monitoring water quality and public funds with open-source AI.

## 🔍 The Problem

In thousands of villages:
- 💧 People pay taxes — but water is dirty
- 💰 Government funds are allocated — but never arrive
- 📉 No records, no accountability, no trust

The system is broken. But it doesn’t have to be.

---

## 💡 The Solution

We're building an **open-source AI system** that:

- ✅ Monitors water quality in real-time (pH, TDS, turbidity)
- ✅ Tracks public fund usage — where money goes, where it stops
- ✅ Detects anomalies — corruption flagged instantly

Every finding is logged transparently — **just like Bitcoin's ledger**.  
No one can hide. No one can delete. No one can lie.

## 🌱 Why Bitcoin?

Bitcoin taught the world what **real transparency** looks like:
- 🔹 Immutable records
- 🔹 No central control
- 🔹 Trust through code, not promises

We're applying the **same philosophy** to village resources — without using Bitcoin itself for payments.
